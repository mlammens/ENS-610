# Reading Response Rubric for Combined ENS 610 / EP 603 Course - FALL 2019

The reading response is assessed based on your achievement of my expectations on five criteria. 
For all criteria, a score of 0, 1, or 2 is given. 0 = did not complete, 1 = partially met expectations, and 2 = met expectations. 
In the event of receiving a 0 or 1, I'll provide written feedback explaining why my expectations were not met.


## Reading response expectations

* Submitted response on time - prior to the beginning of the class meeting time
* Response is of appropriate length (300 - 500 words), well written, concise, and *without unnecessary text*
* Demonstrates a critical reading of the texts based on understanding of major concepts and ability to reference text specifically
* Synthesized information across readings to comment on scientific concepts as they relate to issues of policy, law, and/or applications
* Response is based on scientific principles - opinions are encouraged, but must be relevant to the readings and justified with facts therein
