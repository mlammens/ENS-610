# Meeting 3 - Humans and their environment - Ecotoxicology - Class Plan and Lecture Notes

## Ecotoxicology overview and Q&A (5:40 - 6:10)

### A few points inspired by Sabarwal et al.

* What is an odds-ratio (p 105, section 3.2)
* different susceptibilities based on different genetic backgrounds
* removal of pesticides from ag could lead to a 27% decline in some food stuffs
* levels and kinds of exposure
	  * short-term very high
	  * long-term high
	  * long-term very low
* what is a meta-analysis?
* differences in o,p'-DDT vs others - these are isomers, which in chemistry is a molecule with identical formulas by distinct structures because of atomic differences

||Diseased|Healthy|
|:--|:--:|:--:|
|**Exposed**| $D_E$ | $H_E$ |
|**Not exposed**| $D_N$ | $H_N$ |

* Go over Risk Ratio and Odds Ratio
    * Odds Ratio - "the ratio of the odds of A in the presence of B and the odds of A in the absence of B (Wikipedia, *Odds ratio*, accessed on Sep. 8, 2020)"
        * $OR = \frac{D_E/H_E}{D_N/H_N}$
        * If $OR> 1$ then presence of B raises the *odds* or A
    * Risk Ratio - "ratio of the probability of an outcome in an exposed group to the probability of an outcome in an unexposed group (Wikipedia, *Relative risk*, accessed on Sep. 8, 2020)"
        * $RR = \frac{D_E/N_E}{D_N/N_N}$
* Review epigenetics

## Case-study setup (6:10 - 6:30)

* Go over the general plan
    * Everyone reads the "cases"
    * Breakout into sub-groups to focus on the cases
    * In your groups you focus on addressing how the **review reading** connects to the case
        * How do the major concepts presented by Sabarwal et al. (2018) relate to your case?
    * Determine how your case addresses the **Instructor-established Learning Objectives**
        * **LOs for Ecotoxicology**
            * *Summarize the problems associated with chemicals that exhibit persistence, bioaccumulation, and biological magnification in the environment*
            * *Describe the data that is needed to determine if a chemical is harmful to humans? To specific species? To natural ecosystems? What data / studies exist related to your case?*
            * *Distinguish between acute and chronic toxicities, and identify the exposure duration(s) and mechanism(s) that are most relevant to your case.*
    * After addressing the established LOs, identify new LOs (at least equal in number to the number of group members)
        * These LOs can be specific to your case
        * Use the verbs of learning objectives - [https://www.bu.edu/cme/forms/RSS_forms/tips_for_writing_objectives.pdf](https://www.bu.edu/cme/forms/RSS_forms/tips_for_writing_objectives.pdf)

* **Additional logistics**
    * How should we work?
        * Classes - Discussion board?
        * Google doc?
        * Slack?

## Case-study group work (6:30 - 7:30)

We'll separate into groups and work on our case studies.

## Break (7:30 - 7:40)

## Vitousek updates (7:40 - end of class)
