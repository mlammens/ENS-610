# Meeting 2 - Humans and their environment - Ecotoxicology - Class Plan and Lecture Notes

## Learning objectives for session

* *Summarize the problems associated with chemicals that exhibit persistence, bioaccumulation, and biological magnification in the environment*
* *Describe the data that is needed to determine if a chemical is harmful to humans? To specific species? To natural ecosystems? What data / studies exist related examples we discussed in class?*
* *Distinguish between acute and chronic toxicities, and identify the exposure duration(s) and mechanism(s) that are most relevant to various scenarios (e.g., PCBs in the Hudson vs. Post-9/11 carcinogens).*

## Ecotoxicology overview and Q&A (5:40 - 6:50)

### A few points inspired by Sabarwal et al.

* What is an odds-ratio (p 105, section 3.2)
* different susceptibilities based on different genetic backgrounds
* removal of pesticides from ag could lead to a 27% decline in some food stuffs
* levels and kinds of exposure
	  * short-term very high
	  * long-term high
	  * long-term very low
* what is a meta-analysis?
* differences in o,p'-DDT vs others - these are isomers, which in chemistry is a molecule with identical formulas by distinct structures because of atomic differences

||Diseased|Healthy|
|:--|:--:|:--:|
|**Exposed**| $D_E$ | $H_E$ |
|**Not exposed**| $D_N$ | $H_N$ |

* Go over Risk Ratio and Odds Ratio
    * Odds Ratio - "the ratio of the odds of A in the presence of B and the odds of A in the absence of B (Wikipedia, *Odds ratio*, accessed on Sep. 8, 2020)"
        * $OR = \frac{D_E/H_E}{D_N/H_N}$
        * If $OR> 1$ then presence of B raises the *odds* or A
    * Risk Ratio - "ratio of the probability of an outcome in an exposed group to the probability of an outcome in an unexposed group (Wikipedia, *Relative risk*, accessed on Sep. 8, 2020)"
        * $RR = \frac{D_E/N_E}{D_N/N_N}$
* Review epigenetics

## Hudson River PCB Follow-Up questions (7:00 - 8:00)

* Individually add outstanding / follow-up questions to Hudson River PCB Follow-up doc
* Discuss questions in small groups
* Work on answering questions using any resources available (I recommend Google Scholar)

## Learning Objective Reflection (8:00 - 8:30)

* Review our learning objectives for this session
* Consider how we have achieved them and what is left to learn (one each)
