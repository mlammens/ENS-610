# Overview

This semester I must plan while accomidating COVID-19 issues. Here's what I'm thinking so far:

* It's a small class, so I'm going to go with HyFlex model. Thus, students can participate *synchronously* but remotely as needed.
* I would like to return to my original model, in which the first part of class is based on discussion, led by a student, and the second part is an introduction / overview of the topic for the following class. 
* As opposed to past years, where I based the first half of the semester on Silent Spring, this year I'm planning to switch case studies each week (or so). 


# To-do

* Create survey for the students, in which I solicit case / topic ideas.


# Possible Readings

* Conservation Planning - Jepson, Recoverable Earth: a twenty-first century environmental narrative
