## Learning Objectives



## Readings

IPCC Fifth Assessment Report—Synthesis Report. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/

* We focused on Section 1, Observed Changes and their Causes. Read carefully – Introduction to Section 1 (pp 36-37), Box 1.1, Sections 1.2, 1.5, 1.6. For all other sections, read the bolded text (major points) and enough to understand the figures.

## Class Paper Discussion

* Dissect the statement - "Risk is the potential for consequences when something of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values (p. 36)."
    * How does this compare to other definitions of risk we've seen?
    * What is meant by "diversity of values"?
* Would you classify this document as "carefully crafted"? Why or why not?
* When relating to risk and risk analysis, why might the IPCC reports be written in a way that one might describe as "squishy"?
* Is there a difference between "chaos" and "randomness"?
    * How might this relate to climate change?
* What is one new thing you learned about climate change after reading this report?
* What is one thing that surprised you after reading this report?
