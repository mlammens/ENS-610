# Meeting 3 - Humans and their environment - Ecotoxicology - Lecture Notes


## Things to cover inspired by Sabarwal et al.

* What is an odds-ratio (p 105, section 3.2)
* different suseptabilities based on different genetic backgrounds
* removal of pesticides from ag could lead to a 27% decline in some food stuffs
* levels and kinds of exposure
	* short-term very high
	* long-term high
	* long-term very low
* what is a meta-analysis?
* differences in o,p'-DDT vs others - these are isomers, which in chemistry is a molecule with identical formulas by distrinct structures because of atomic differences
* Go over Risk Ratio and Odds Ratio
* Review epigenetics


## Discussion based on Carson

* On pages 6 and 7, Carson proposes that it will take "the life of generations" to match the pace of change and achieve some sort of "balance" with the new chemicals. Then on page 8 she talks about the rapid evolution of pest species to these chemicals. These two statements appear at odds - why? And what resolution might we find?
* Carson's writing leans towards personifying nature, or at least giving nature some sort of corperal feeling. This makes us sympathetic toward "nature".
