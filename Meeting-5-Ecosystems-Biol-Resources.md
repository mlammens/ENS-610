## Reading Response Prompt

For your response this week, write a 350 - 500 word pitch to the United States Department of Agriculture about why they should establish a grant program to support whole-ecosystem research projects on human environmental impacts. You do not need to confine your proposal to the impacts of pesticides, but you should support your pitch with references to this weeks readings (and previous readings if you so desire).
