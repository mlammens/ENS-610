# Meeting 5 - Ecosystems, Biodiversity, and Biological Resources - Class Plan and Lecture Notes

## Learning Objectives for Ecosystems - Biodiversity and Biological Resources

* Identify key principles of population ecology that are important in understanding an environmental issue.
* Identify key principles of community ecology that are important in understanding an environmental issue.
* Describe the ways that *biodiversity* is impacted in a given environmental issue, both directly and indirectly.

## Logistics Updates (5:40 to 5:50)

* Review paper assignments posted

## Communities and Food Webs (5:50 to 6:30)

* In assigned groups, make two food web diagrams for the Yellowstone National Park system - one without wolves and one with wolves.
    * Include **directional** arrows that indicate the direction of the flow of energy
    * Use *something* to indicate the strength of the interaction between components (i.e., species) in your food web. Some examples are weight of the line for the arrow, or collor of the arrow, etc...

## Discussion of the readings (6:30 - 7:00)

* Identify *at least* one question or comment you would like to make / address regarding the reading. It could be identical, or related, to a Perusall comment, or something completely new.
* Identify one way that both of the readings you did were connected. That is, one theme, idea, or principle that was common to both readings.
* Put these comments or questions up on the associated pages of the Jamboard

## LOs and your environmental issue (7:00 - 7:30)

In your groups, address each of the three LOs with respect to your second reading (either pesticide effects or shifting ranges).
Do this in the shared Google Doc.

## Class and Lecture Notes

### Reading

* Ripple, W. J., & Beschta, R. L. (2012). Trophic cascades in Yellowstone: The first 15years after wolf reintroduction. Biological Conservation, 145(1), 205â€“213. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.11.005


### Ideas and Notes

### Ripple and Beschta

* Fifteen years on, still recovering. This is almost surely still true to this day.
* Yellowstone - a three trophic level system
* There's a strong analogy between Yellowstone's elk and the northeast's deer problems. No wolf or other top predators.
* On page 206, the authors state "Two potential bottom-up factors ..." -- let's discuss bottom up versus top down ecosystem control. 
* Increases in plant growth are patchy, associated with perceived risk of predation.
