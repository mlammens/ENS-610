## Reading Response Prompt

For your response this week, write a 350 - 500 word pitch to the United States Department of Agriculture about why they should establish a grant program to support whole-ecosystem research projects on human environmental impacts. You do not need to confine your proposal to the impacts of pesticides, but you should support your pitch with references to this weeks readings (and previous readings if you so desire).

## Ideas and Notes

### Kohler and Triebskorn

* Dramatic increase in population versus modest increase in farmed land begins with a compelling argument for the necessity of industrial farming, including pesticides. Thoughts?

* "Higher levels of biological organization: populations, communities, and ecosystems" -> related to some of the lecture materials.

* Most research has been done on fish, insects, and some birds, amphibians, and arachnids. What do these have in common? Why these species?

* Over-emphasis on insecticides, in terms of research. Again, why?

* Developed vs. developing world and use of different kinds of pesticides - why overuse of "old" pesticides in developing world?

* Linking effects at the individual level to consequences at the population level. How does this happen? Discuss "emergent properties".

* Endocrine effects often linked to population declines, but not very much on behavioral effects. These effects could be quite important, and a major source of mortality.

* Regarding exposure to multiple chemicals, the authors write "Generally, single- chemical risk assessment will probably under- estimate the actual risks of pesticide mixtures to fish, as combinations of organophosphates and carbamates were shown to exert synergistic neu- rotoxicity and unpredicted mortality in Pacific salmon". 

* **Bradford-Hill's Criteria**

Below is taken from the Wikipedia article on Bradford-Hill Criteria:

	- Strength (effect size): A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.
	- Consistency (reproducibility): Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.
	- Specificity: Causation is likely if there is a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.[1]
	- Temporality: The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).
	- Biological gradient: Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.[1]
	- Plausibility: A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful (but Hill noted that knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge).
	- Coherence: Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect. However, Hill noted that "... lack of such [laboratory] evidence cannot nullify the epidemiological effect on associations".
	- Experiment: "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".
Analogy: The use of analogies or similarities between the observed association and any other associations.

* I found the below quote important to consider further. Where do we go from here?

> For the most part, pesticide research remains a scattered assemblage of data recorded at the molecular, cellular, physiological, or individual levels for different species on the one hand, and records of population declines or altered community structure in areas with high pesticide input or persistence on the other hand.

* The Atrazine, phytoplankton, nutrient, snail, trematode example (page 763) is a classic case of just how complex these systems can be, and why understanding effects before hand can be so challenging.

* Recovery is possible, but it depends on the systems.

### Ripple and Beschta

* Fifteen years on, still recovering. This is almost surely still true to this day.

* Yellowstone - a three trophic level system

* There's a strong analogy between Yellowstone's elk and the northeast's deer problems. No wolf or other top predators.

* On page 206, the authors state "Two potential bottom-up factors ..." -- let's discuss bottom up versus top down ecosystem control. 

* Increases in plant growth are patchy, associated with perceived risk of predation.

### Carson, Ch 6-8

* Raises the idea of selective spraying (p 74), an example of her not being categorically against pesticides.

* The methods of selective spraying are what are now often employed in these kinds of uses, though blanket spraying is still employed in agriculture.

* On p 76, Carson discusses effects of pesticides (2,4 D) on respiration in the cell. This connects back to our readings from Meeting 3, going through the various impacts of pesticides. 

* In Ch 6, there are numerous examples of indirect effects - adding marigolds to rosebeds removes nematodes - are their cases of the opposite effect in nature? Removal of some plants allows others (e.g., grasses) to become pests by releasing them from competition, or the ragweed example - killing its competitors makes for *more* ragweed the following year.

* The end of Ch 6 is also where she starts talking about non-native species and biocontrol. This is interesting because 50 years on, we know that these are quite complicated topics, and sometimes our biocontrol becomes very problematic.

* In Ch 7, Carson makes it very clear that her goal is to inform the citizen of the negative consequences of pesticide use, so that they can force better decisions to be made at governmental levels. It is interesting to consider if, and how, this was successful. My limited understanding of science communication is that simply increasing factual knowledge is not sufficient to change minds. This is very apparent in the discussions around climate change. So what was it about pesticides that made this work better? Or did it really?
