# Meeting 5 - Ecosystems, Biodiversity, and Biological Resources - Class Plan and Lecture Notes

## Discussion of Ecosystems - Energy, Cycles, and Earth Systems Case Studies (5:40 - 6:40)

* Small groups regroup! (5:45 - 6:00)
* Full class discussion (6:00 - 6:40)

## Short break (6:40 - 6:45)

## Ecosystems - Biodiversity and Biological Resources - Lecture (6:45 - 7:30)

## Case study discussions and LO work (7:30 - 8:30)

### Instructor-established Learning Objectives for Ecosystems - Biodiversity and Biological Resources

* Identify key principles of population ecology that are important in understanding your case study.
* Identify key principles of community ecology that are important in understanding your case study.
* Describe the ways that *biodiversity* is impacted in your case study, both directly and indirectly.





## Class and Lecture Notes

### Reading

* Ripple, W. J., & Beschta, R. L. (2012). Trophic cascades in Yellowstone: The first 15years after wolf reintroduction. Biological Conservation, 145(1), 205â€“213. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.11.005


## Ideas and Notes

### Ripple and Beschta

* Fifteen years on, still recovering. This is almost surely still true to this day.
* Yellowstone - a three trophic level system
* There's a strong analogy between Yellowstone's elk and the northeast's deer problems. No wolf or other top predators.
* On page 206, the authors state "Two potential bottom-up factors ..." -- let's discuss bottom up versus top down ecosystem control. 
* Increases in plant growth are patchy, associated with perceived risk of predation.
