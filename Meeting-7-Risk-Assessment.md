## Brief paper discussion of Schwarzenbach et al. 2010 (5:40 - 5:50 PM)

## Small group discussions and presentation preperation (5:50 - 6:50 PM)

### Instructor-established Learning Objectives for Water Pollution

* Describe the eight major categories of water pollution (see Water Pollution slide deck) in general, and identify which categories each of the case studies relates to.
* Contrast the difference between point source and nonpoint source pollution, and identify which is a more appropriate classification for each of the case studies.


## Break (6:50 - 7:00 PM)

## Group presenations (7:00 - 7:30 PM)

## Case Study discussion and LO work (7:30 - 8:30 PM)

### Instructor-established Learning Objectives Toxic Persistence and Risk Assesssment

* Identify the utility of risk assessment as a tool for decision making. Describe how risk assessment is used in your specific case study.
* Describe how you would begin to apply a risk assessment framework to addressing environmental challenges such as those we've discussed in our case studies this semester.
