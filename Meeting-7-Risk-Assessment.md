## Notes on the class

This evening's class went really well. I did not have any materials to present, because in past years I used slides that I used earlier in the semester (related to toxicited and what not). The conversation when really well, I think in a large part because of how well Katie did in prepping. A good discussion was had that lasted about 2 hours.
