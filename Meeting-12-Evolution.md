# Meeting 9 - Evolution

## Readings

### Overview

* Hoffmann, A. A., & Sgrò, C. M. (2011). Climate change and evolutionary adaptation. Nature, 470(7335), 479–485. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09670

### Case Studies

* Bonnet, T., Morrissey, M. B., Morris, A., Morris, S., Clutton-Brock, T. H., Pemberton, J. M., & Kruuk, L. E. B. (2019). The role of selection and evolution in changing parturition date in a red deer population. PLOS Biology, 17(11), e3000493. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000493


## Class Paper discussion (5:40 - 6:20 PM)

* Is evolution slow or fast? What does it depend on?
* What role could our "highly connected world" play in the evolution / adaptation of species?
* Are physiological limits or life-history traits more likely to be the traits that adapt to climate change?
* NOTE: briefly discus warm-edge / cold-edge hypotheses regarding what causes species ranges.
* NOTE: Review the breeder's equation - $R = h^2 S$ - where R = is the response to selection, h is the heritability, and S is the selection differential (difference in the selected mean versus mean of base population). Draw figure on "board".
* Which is a greater source of adaptive potential, standing genetic variation or new mutations?
* Phylogenetic constraints - what do we mean by this? Can you give me an example (even a wild one)?

### Misc. notes

* Discuss micro- and macro-evolution, and possibly the evolutionary synthesis.
* When talking about spiders paper, maybe go over group selection (very briefly)


## Group discussions (6:20 - 7:20 PM)

### Instructor-established Learning Objectives Evolution

* Identify the selection pressures on species associated with environmental changes.
* Describe the evolutionary processes associated with adaptation to novel environmental conditions.
