# Meeting 12 - Evolution

## Learning Objectives

* Identify the selection pressures on species associated with environmental changes.
* Describe the evolutionary processes associated with adaptation to novel environmental conditions. 


## Readings

* Hoffmann, A. A., & Sgrò, C. M. (2011). Climate change and evolutionary adaptation. Nature, 470(7335), 479–485. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09670
* Welch, C., & Ringman, S. (2013, November 3). Can Sea Life Adapt? Pulitzer Center. https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/can-sea-life-adapt


## Class Paper discussion (5:40 - 6:30 PM)

* Is evolution slow or fast? What does it depend on?
* What's the differences between genotype, phenotype, and morphology?
* What role could our "highly connected world" play in the evolution / adaptation of species?
* Why might invasive species be highly "adaptable"?
* Are physiological limits or life-history traits more likely to be the traits that adapt to climate change?
* NOTE: briefly discus warm-edge / cold-edge hypotheses regarding what causes species ranges.
* NOTE: Review the breeder's equation - $R = h^2 S$ - where R = is the response to selection, h is the heritability, and S is the selection differential (difference in the selected mean versus mean of base population). Draw figure on "board".
* What's the difference between *plastic* and *genetic* changes?
* Which is a greater source of adaptive potential, standing genetic variation or new mutations?
* Phylogenetic constraints - what do we mean by this? Can you give me an example (even a wild one)?
* How do we include evolution / adaptation into plans for conservation and/or dealing with environmental issues?

### Misc. notes

* Discuss micro- and macro-evolution, and possibly the evolutionary synthesis.


## Group project (6:30 - 7:30 PM)

* Create a research summary for environmental managers in the style of the RISCC group [https://www.risccnetwork.org/research-summaries](https://www.risccnetwork.org/research-summaries)
* Present management implications to the rest of the group
