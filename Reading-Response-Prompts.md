# ENS 610 / EP 603 - FALL 2019 - Reading Response Prompts

## Meeting 3

* Carson 1-3
* Schaebel et al. 2017
* Sabarwal et al. 2018

All three of this week's readings touch upon the human health impacts of exposure to pesticides. This is a theme that will be prevalent throughout Carson. What are the major themes that are consistent in all three of these readings? Are there any concepts / findings that are particularly important in one of these works that is not highlighted in the others? And finally, how does the presentation of the evidence in support of the authors claims vary between these readings?
