# Fall 2021

## Post

* The course ran as a HiFlex. Generally about half the students were in-person (masked) and half were on the Zoom station.
* I assigned readings through Perusall. Each week included 2-3 readings, which I selected. We only had about 6 reading responses over the course of the semester.
* Generally each week I lectured for about an hour (longer than I'd planned), then we had group work / assignments. The group work seemed to go ok, but I didn't have very good evaluations for learning objectives. I had the work done on collaborative docs (i.e., google docs or jam board), but never clearly thought out how I'd connect these assignments to assessment.
* There was no exams this year, which I regret (again). I'm just not sure whether we should have open-ended exam questions (i.e., essay questions) or multiple choice questions? My gut is to say the former, *sensu* prelim questions. 
* I also feel like I need to spread out the term paper even more throughout the semester. I need to give them more time to work on writing, editing, and **peer reviews**, which I had to skip this year because of the variation in quality of the first drafts.

# Fall 2020

## Pre

This semester I must plan while accommodating COVID-19 issues. Here's what I'm thinking so far:

* It's a small class, so I'm going to go with HyFlex model. Thus, students can participate *synchronously* but remotely as needed.
* I would like to return to my original model, in which the first part of class is based on discussion, led by a student, and the second part is an introduction / overview of the topic for the following class. 
* As opposed to past years, where I based the first half of the semester on Silent Spring, this year I'm planning to switch case studies each week (or so).
