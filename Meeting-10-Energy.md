## Reading Notes

### Ciais et al. pp 480 - 514

Some of these notes are from other sections. I read the exec summary and skimmed section 6.1.

* p. 475 - the nitrogen and carbon cycles are tightly coupled because of metabolic needs of organisms for both elements

* p. 480 - understanding past rates of increases in GHGs shows that current rates are larger than the period in the past 22k years up to the industrial era.

* General impressions - this document is information packed, and not exactly a page turner. But I think from the perspective of providing information dense readings, this one is spot on.
