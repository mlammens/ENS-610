## Reading Notes

### Ciais et al. pp 480 - 514

* General impressions - this document is information packed, and not exactly a page turner. But I think from the perspective of providing information dense readings, this one is spot on.

* As we begin discussing this material, I think it's vital that we recall what we learned back when first discussing biogeochemical cycles - Earth is energetically open, but materially closed. What does this mean for Carbon and Nitrogen, as we think about them in relation to GHG and climate change?

* Several points in this reading highlight the interconnections between the C and N biogeochemical cycles. In this course, we first cover these cycles early in the semester. While reading this section, did you reflect on the points highlighted here, and if you were asked to, what might you say? Does anything here change, enhance, muddle, etc. your previous thinking on biogeochemical cycles?

* p. 475 - the nitrogen and carbon cycles are tightly coupled because of metabolic needs of organisms for both elements

* p. 480 - understanding past rates of increases in GHGs shows that current rates are larger than the period in the past 22k years up to the industrial era.


<!---
I was not especially happy with how this session went in 2020. This might be in part because there were so many discussion leaders. I also took a lot of the time (or at least more than usual) going over key concepts I though are important.

Ultimately, I'm still trying to figure out a way to make this class interactive. I just haven't come up with a way that I'm fully happy with. Perhaps ironically, I think when I taught the course at the law school was when it was most interactive. Maybe I need to return to that approach.
