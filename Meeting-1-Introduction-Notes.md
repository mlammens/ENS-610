# Meeting 1 - Class Notes

## Learning objectives

* Describe what environmental science is as a field and how it is applied to address environmental challenges.
* Identify differences in scientific literature and sources of information.
* Identify and review primary literature sources related to major topics in environmental science.

## What is Environmental Science?

> The interdisciplinary study of Earth's living and non-living **systems** with a focus on understanding the general principles of how the natural world functions. This knowledge is applied to understand the impacts humans have on Earth systems and *how to mitigate* these impacts.

## Compare with Environmental Studies

> The inter- and multi-disciplinary study that examines the interplay between social, legal, cultural, and management aspects of environmental issues from multiple perspectives. 

### Fields in environmental science

* Biology
* Ecology
* Geography
* Chemistry
* Geology
* Physics
* Economics
* Sociology
* Demography
* Politics

## Environmental Science - a systems approach

* **System** A set of components that interact and function as a whole
* **Global Earth Systems** Climate, atmosphere, land, coastal zones, ocean
* **Ecosystem** A natural system consisting of a community of organisms and its physical environment

### System processes

Again, systems are a set of components that interact. They include a set of processes the result in some larger patter - e.g. a forest or lake ecosystem.
Most of the processes are related to changes in the interactions of the components.

* **Dynamic equilibrium** The rate of change in one direction is the same as the rate of change in the ‘opposite’ direction

* **Feedback** When a change in one part of a system leads to a change in another part

* **Negative feedback** A change in condition that triggers a response that counteracts, or reverses, the changed condition; often keeps a system in dynamic equilibrium

* **Positive feedback** A change in condition that triggers a response that intensifies the changing condition; Often disruptive

**Activity** Work through some examples of negative and positive feedback in systems


## Vitousek et al. 1997 Presentation and Discussion

* Is this paper an "environmental science paper"? Why/ why not?
* What kind of paper is this? Is it describing the results of a novel experimental or observational study?
* Note differences between Reviews versus Original Research papers (note reviews do not have to deviate from an Introduction - Methods - Results- Discussion (IMRD) approach, but oftent do)
* This paper is one product of the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative of the Ecological Society of America
* SBI was an initiative to "define research priorities for ecology in the closing decade of the 20th century" (Lubchenco et al. 1991, *Ecology* 72(2) 371-412.
* New initiatives from ESA have sprung from SBI, including the [Ecological Visions Project](https://www.esa.org/ecovisions/ev_projects/about_project.php)

**Scholar slide** This article has been cited almost 10000 times. 

* What does that mean? 
* How many citations do you think most papers get? 
* Is this necessarily an indication of the articles quality?

**Conceptual model slide** 

* What are some of the direct effects noted?
* What are some of the indirect effects?
* Why is *Loss of biological diversity* only indirect?

**Percent change slide**

* What information is this figure conveying? 
* Considering the impacts human disturbances have on Earth systems, why might this image not be has helpful as it first appears? **ANS** We don't know if a 50% change in land is more or less impactful than a 25% change in CO2 or >60% change in Marine fisheries.
* We are looking at these changes at the global scale. How do you think the relate to changes at the local scale?

**Fisheries development slide**

* What is this figure telling us?

**Carbon emissions slide**

* As pointed out in the article, most emissions come from the developed nations.
* Recall that this article was written more than 20 years ago. What may have changed in that time, and how could it impact Earth systems differently?

**Logical fallacies**

* Throughout the semester we must keep an eye out for when ***we*** commit logical fallacies in our arguments and discussions.
* You should feel free to call me out if I do this (which I probably do, often).
* Go through fallacies and examples.
* Which is hardest for you?

### Concepts and discussion questions

* In 1997, when this was written, the authors stated that **land transformations** represented the *most substantial human alteration of the Earth system*. Based on your current knowledge, do you think this is still the case?
* In 1962, Rachel Carson published **Silent Spring**, where she makes the case that the use and mis-use of pesticides was the most substantial human impact on Earth systems. Would you still agree with this statement? What does your answer say about your outlook on addressing / dealing with environmental challenges? 
* Why do you think land transformations are so impactful? **ANS** From text "land transformation interacts strongly with most other components of global environmental change".
