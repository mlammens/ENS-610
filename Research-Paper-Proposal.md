# Research Paper Proposal Guidelines

Your research paper proposal should be a short narative describing the topic and question you wish to investigate in your paper. 
The overall goal of your research paper is for you to become better aquanted with the literature in your field of interest -- or what you currently think is your field of interest!
Another major goal is for you to identify knowledge gaps, or areas that need further study. 
This will help you in developing thesis or capstone topic ideas later in your graduate studies.
Most of all, the proposal is a first step in your research. 
I will provide feedback and comments on the proposal, making suggestions on where you may look for source materials, how you might adjust a topic foci, etc.. 

Here are some detailed expectations:

* Approximately 400 - 500 words.
* Well written and logically structured.
* The proposal *may* contain references or citations, but they are *not* required.
