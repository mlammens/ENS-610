# Meeting 8 - Climate Change

## Learning Objectives

* Become familiar with the evidence for anthropogenic climate change
* Identify links between increases in atmospheric greenhouse gasses and climate change
* Identify ways that population growth and human development have contributed to factors leading to climate change

## Readings

IPCC Fifth Assessment Report—Synthesis Report. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/

* We focused on Section 1, Observed Changes and their Causes. Read carefully – Introduction to Section 1 (pp 36-37), Box 1.1, Sections 1.2, 1.5, 1.6. For all other sections, read the bolded text (major points) and enough to understand the figures.

## Group Discussions

* Considering this week's readings, identify three **new** things you learned and three surprises or outstanding questions.

* Right now, COP26 is going on in Glasgow, Scotland. Therefore, there are a **lot** of news pieces related to the meeting and climate change more generally. Find one news story that is particularly interesting to your group. Be prepared to provide a *very* brief summary of the article (less than 2-3 minutes) and **fact check** at least three statements made in the article with your knowledge of climate change. (A **fact check** can be verifying, refuting, or modifying / qualifying as statement.)

*Didn't have time for the two activities below in FA21*

* *If there's time* - the US government funds a number of continental scale environmental research programs. Two such programs are [LTER](https://lternet.edu/) and [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/). Look over the materials at these websites and identify ways these research programs may address some of the challenges / questions posed in the Grimm et al. paper.

* Compare and contrast the main points in Grimm et al. 2008 and Tromboni et al. 2021.
    - Identify 2-3 concepts that are overlapping and 2-3 that are distinct
    

## Class Paper Discussion

* Dissect the statement - "Risk is the potential for consequences when something of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values (p. 36)."
    * How does this compare to other definitions of risk we've seen?
    * What is meant by "diversity of values"?
* Would you classify this document as "carefully crafted"? Why or why not?
* When relating to risk and risk analysis, why might the IPCC reports be written in a way that one might describe as "squishy"?
* Is there a difference between "chaos" and "randomness"?
    * How might this relate to climate change?
* What is one new thing you learned about climate change after reading this report?
* What is one thing that surprised you after reading this report?
