## Course delivery format / modality:

For the Fall of 2020, this course will be taught as **HyFlex**. 
That means that students will have the opportunity to meet in-person or connect to class *synchronously* via Zoom. 
Because of social distancing guidelines, our classroom can accommodate 8 students in person. 
We will work together to arrange a schedule that allows all students who wish for in-person instruction to have this experience.

Course description
------------------

This course is designed to help future environmental scientists and
policy makers achieve the level of scientific literacy required to
assess the quality of scientific evidence and to think critically about
environmental issues. Students will be guided through key topics in
environmental science, expanding their scientific literacy and helping
them to connect how scientific knowledge and research applies to, and
influences, environmental research, law, and policy.

Class materials
---------------

**Course readings:**

During the semester, we will read peer reviewed articles, as well as sections of several IPCC reports (AR5 and other special reports).
The readings will be shared via a shared [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library and through our class page on Pace's Learning Management System (LMS) [Classes](https://classes.pace.edu)

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon successful completion of this course, a student should be able to:

-   Demonstrate scientific literacy in written and verbal
    *communications*.
-   Apply a conceptual and systems level understanding of our
    environment and the flux of energy through it in addressing
    environmental issues.
-   Describe the key biogeochemical cycles that are integral to life on
    earth, including the hydrologic cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen
    cycle, and articulate human impacts on these cycles.
-   Discuss the interconnectedness of organisms in natural ecosystems
    and the importance of biodiversity and *explain its importance* to
    human and ecosystem well-being.
-   Identify major biodiversity and environmental conservation
    strategies in use locally and globally, and *describe the social
    issues* that complicate conservation efforts.
-   Explain the impacts resource use and extraction has on natural
    systems and argue what is meant by sustainability and "ecosystem
    services" and why they are *important in law and policy*.
-   Describe how humans impact the environment through coupled
    human-natural systems, and be able to *propose studies and policies*
    to further investigate and mitigate these effects.
-   Identify the difficulties associated with solving environmental
    problems, and *articulate* why these are often termed “wicked
    problems”.

Program Learning Objectives
-------------------------

This course covers the following MS Environmental Science program-level
learning objectives:

-   Communicate complex scientific findings and exchange knowledge
    regarding multi-faceted environmental issues with a broad spectrum
    of audiences
-   Contextualize research on solving environmental challenges that
    includes economic, social, and political factors
-   Understand and critique the current state of knowledge on
    environmental issues and identify important knowledge gaps that need
    further investigation 

This course covers the following MA Environmental Policy program-level
learning objectives:

-   Communicate and exchange knowledge on the concepts behind
    environmental problems and policy solutions, based on scientific
    findings, with probable stakeholders such as policymakers,
    practitioners, and community members 
-   Employ interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary thinking in order to
    analyze effective environmental policy choices for industry,
    government, and non-governmental institutions 

Class structure
---------------

Each class meeting will be 3 hours. The class will be case-based and will include discussion and
group work, with inclusion of lecture material from Prof.
Aiello-Lammens to cover major concepts. Each week we will discuss the assigned
readings, and connect the topics in these readings to key concepts in
environmental science and policy. During a typical
class session, approximately 1/3 of the time will be dedicated to
discussion of a case, 1/3 to lecture, and 1/3 to group work.

Assignments and assessments
---------------------------

Rubrics will be provided for class assessments.

-   Weekly reading comments - Perusall (10%)
-   Weekly reading response - (25%)
-   Case / Discussion leader (10%)
-   Research paper proposal (5%)
-   Research paper annotated bibliography (5%)
-   Draft research paper (10%)
-   Peer-review of research paper (10%)
-   Final research paper (25%)

### Weekly reading comments - Perusall

Each week, we will read 1-2 papers that are common to the whole class.
These papers will be shared via a Zotero group library (we'll go over Zotero in Week 2) and via Perusall (linked from our Classes page).
Using Perusall, you will make highlights and marginal comments on the papers as a class.
I will look to see that you are participating in this process, but your grade will not be based on the number or length of your comments.

### Weekly reading responses 

All students must come to class ready to engage with the material and
fully participate in the discussion and synthesis session. To stimulate
thinking prior to the meeting time, each student is required to submit a
300 to 500 word written response to the reading.

### Case / Discussion leader

The case / discussion leader is responsible for leading the discussion and
synthesis session.
They will lead the group in establishing Case Learning Objectives and ensure that the work required to achieve these objectives is partitioned equally among group members.
During the Case discussion, they will be prepared with a
brief (approx. 5 minute) overview statement on the case and class reading and they will have a plan to guide the discussion and synthesis session to ensure that each group member has a chance to address at least one of the learning objectives.


### Peer-review of research paper

You will perform a peer-review of the research paper draft for a fellow student. 
We will discuss this assignment and process further in class.

### Term research paper

The research paper should be a thorough review of a topic in
environmental science ***OR*** of the scientific basis for a piece of
environmental law or policy. The paper should be 10 - 15 pages of
content (double spaced), excluding figures, title page, references
cited, etc.. At least 25 references to ***peer-reviewed*** or other
scholarly work should be used and cited appropriately in-text. The final
draft of the paper is due on the last day of the semester
– ***December 4***.

I will read and comment on **a draft of your paper**, and will expect my comments to be addressed in the final version.
A draft will be due by ***November 17***.


Course Policies
---------------

### Attendance

Attendance and punctuality are required. Excused absences will be
considered, but must be discussed with Prof. Aiello-Lammens. Unexcused
absences and/or consistent lateness will negatively impact a student’s
final assessment and could result in failure.

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers and tablets may be necessary to complete some in-class
assignments. However, I expect you to respectful and professional, and
not to be “surfing the internet” during class. All computers, tablets,
phones, etc. should be closed and put away when not needed for course
work.

### The Writing Center

The Pace University Writing Center is an excellent resource for students
wishing to advance their writing skills. You can make an appointment
by visiting [https://www.pace.edu/dyson/centers/writing-center/plv/graduate-students](https://www.pace.edu/dyson/centers/writing-center/plv/graduate-students)
and following the instructions there.

### Academic integrity

All members of the Pace community are expected to behave with honesty
and integrity. Students will be held to the standards outlined in the
policy in the Student Handbook (quoted below) and the [Academic
Integrity
Code](http://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/files/student-handbook/Academic-Integrity-Code.pdf):

> Students are required to be honest and ethical in satisfying their
> academic assignments and requirements. Academic integrity requires
> that, except as may be authorized by the instructor, a student must
> demonstrate independent intellectual and academic achievements.
> Therefore, when a student uses or relies upon an idea or material
> obtained from another source, proper credit or attribution must be
> given. A failure to give credit or attribution to ideas or material
> obtained from an outside source is plagiarism. Plagiarism is strictly
> forbidden. Every student is responsible for giving the proper credit
> or attribution for any quotation, idea, data, or other material
> obtained from another source that is presented (whether orally or in
> writing) in the student’s papers, reports, submissions, examinations,
> presentations and the like.
>
> Individual schools and programs may have adopted additional standards
> of academic integrity. Therefore, students are responsible for
> familiarizing themselves with the academic integrity policies of the
> University as well as of the individual schools and programs in which
> they are enrolled. A student who fails to comply with the standards of
> academic integrity is subject to disciplinary actions such as, but not
> limited to, a reduction in the grade for the assignment or the course,
> a failing grade in the assignment or the course, suspension and/or
> dismissal from the University.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

The University’s commitment to equal educational opportunities for
students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations
for the needs of students with disabilities. To request an accommodation
for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register
with the Coordinator of Disability Services for his or her campus. No
one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need and arrange
for an accommodation except the Coordinator of Disability Services.
Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact the
Coordinator of Disability Services on behalf of a student. For further
information, please see Information for Students with Disabilities on
the University’s web site.\
To receive accommodation for any disability, students must contact the
campus Counseling Center (Pace Plaza, 212-346-1526; Westchester,
914-773-3710).

### Pace University COVID-19 Safety

CDC guidelines and University policy require proper face covering use in all classrooms, conference rooms, hallways, elevators, and other common areas. 
Face coverings are required even if you are more than 6 feet from another individual in a common indoor area. 
We must work together to protect others and ourselves from the transmission of COVID-19.  
Any student entering class without a face covering will be asked to: a) don a face covering or b) go to Security to obtain a face covering if the student does not have one. 
Students who do neither of these things will be asked to leave class and they will be marked absent for the session. 
Students are expected to be familiar with the current COVID-19 regulations, which are posted on the [Return to Campus](https://www.pace.edu/return-to-campus) website. 
See also [up-to-date policies and announcements](https://www.pace.edu/return-to-campus/communications-resources#recent) and more information about [Pace University’s response to COVID-19](https://www.pace.edu/coronavirus).
