# Meeting 4 - Ecosystems, Energy, Cycles and Earth Systems - Class Plan and Lecture Notes

### Learning Objectives for Ecosystems - Energy, Cycles, and Earth Systems

* Describe the biogeochemical cycles that are most immediately related to a given environmental issue.
* Identify human perturbations to the biogeochemical cycles related to a given environmental issue, and describe how those perturbations contributed to any environmental problems.
* Identify and describe the major Earth systems (atmospheric wind currents, ocean currents, etc.) related to a given environmental issue.

## Follow-up with Hudson River PCBs (5:40 - 6:30 PM)

* Clean-up the document, **BUT DONT ADD MORE REFERENCES**
    * Check formatting of references
    * Add your **BRIEF** synopsis if it's not there already
    * Put the synopsis first, followed by the references **IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER**
* Give the class a brief update
    * You do not have to be able to fully answer the question, just tell us what you've found

## Introduction to ecosystems Q&A (6:30 - 6:50 PM)

## Meeting 4 review reading (6:50 - 7:20 PM)

## Case study discussion and activity (7:20 - 8:00 PM)

In groups, construct a visual representation of the coupled human-natural systems related to your focal topic for this week (Carbon sequestration or Gulf of Mexico 'dead-zone'). 
Your visual could be a mind-map (concept map), something similar to Figure 1 in Tromboni et al. 2021, or something entirely different and original.

Instructor notes:

Small group discussions seemed to go really well, but full class discussion *felt* like it required more facilitation on my part.

But overall, I thought the discussion went well. I like the format where we take 15 minutes in our small groups, then come back to the bigger groups (rather than skipping the small groups).

The ecosystem introduction was a bit ad libbed, and went off in a few different directions, but I hope interesting to the students?
