# Meeting 4 - Ecosystems, Energy, Cycles and Earth Systems - Class Plan and Lecture Notes

## Discussion of Ecotoxicology and Pollution Cases (5:40 - 6:50 PM)

## Break (6:50 - 7:00 PM)

## Brief introduction to ecosystmes - Q&A (7:00 - 7:30 PM)

### Meeting 4 review reading

* Pickett, S. T. A., and M. L. Cadenasso. 2002. The Ecosystem as a Multidimensional Concept: Meaning, Model, and Metaphor. Ecosystems 5:1–10.

## Notes from Pickett and Cadenasso 2002

* Three uses of the ecosystem concept
	* Meaning - a definition of an ecosystem - "Tansley defined the ecosystem as a biotic community or assemblage and its associated physical environment in a specific place."\
		* Scale independent - this is counter to common uses of "ecosystem ecology" as a concept
		* **Q** How does this compare to what was in our slide deck about ecosystem ecology?
	* Model - the generality of the definition of "ecosystem" necessitates the use of models to "translate" the ecosystem meaning into something usable
		* **Q** Does the use of the term model mean that we are talking about something represented as an equation or in some formal mathematical context?
		* **Q** How does the answer to the above jive with what you think when you hear the word "model"? How might you be clear about this when you are discussing "models" in different forums - i.e., public talks, policy rec docs, teaching, etc.?
	* Metaphor
* **Q** The authors here note that Tansley in 1935 encouraged the inclusion of humans and their impacts into ecosystems. How does this compare to how you all learned about ecosystems, or how you perceive ecosystems, or how you think the public perceives ecosystems?
* Cite section on page 3, start of "Types of Models", beginning with "One common focus of ecosystem models is energy."
* **Q** How does this relate to biogeochemical cycles?
* In the paper, there is the mention of "ecological economics". This is related closely to the concepts of ecosystem services. 
	* **Q** What do you think are some of benefits and challenges of ecosystem services?
* **Q** The authors point out that recent research suggests that "persistent ecosystems often contain negative feedback loops" -- why? 
* **Q** What's the difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium ecosystem models, and what does the choice of using one or the other say about assumptions regarding the consistency of an ecosystem
* **Q** Do we think the use of ecosystem as metaphor is useful? 


## Case study discussions and LO work

### Meeting 4 case studies

* Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone - Smith, C. (2017, August 2). New Jersey-Size “Dead Zone” Is Largest Ever in Gulf of Mexico. National Geographic. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/08/gulf-mexico-hypoxia-water-quality-dead-zone/
* CO2 impacts of 2018 California Wildfires - Berwyn, B. (2018, August 23). How Wildfires Can Affect Climate Change (and Vice Versa). InsideClimate News. https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23082018/extreme-wildfires-climate-change-global-warming-air-pollution-fire-management-black-carbon-co2

#### Case study guiding scenarios

* Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone - you are planning to lobby the USDA to request that the enact a series of policies to mitigate the impacts of eutrification in the Gulf of Mexico. What are the key points of your science-based policies?

* CO2 impacts of 2018 California Wildfires - you are asked to weigh-in on the debate as to whether climate change or land management has a greater impact on fire severity in the American West. In actuality, this is a multi-faceted and complex issue. What are the key points you would raise in addressing this debate?


### Instructor-established Learning Objectives for Ecosystems - Energy, Cycles, and Earth Systems

* Describe the biogeochemical cycles that are most immediately related to the case study.
* Identify human perturbations to the biogeochemical cycles related to the case study, and describe how those perturbations contributed to the environmental problem presented
* Identify and describe the major Earth systems (atmospheric wind currents, ocean currents, etc.) that related to the case study.
