## Reading Response Prompt

Given what you have learned about the ecosystem concept from Pickett and Cadenasso (2002), and the case studies documented in Carson 1962 and Arias-Estevez et al. 2008, why do you think it is important to investigate environmental impacts at the level of an ecosystem? Back up your answer with examples from the reading. What situations can you imagine in which we could ignore the ecosystem context, and instead focus only on individual populations or communities?
