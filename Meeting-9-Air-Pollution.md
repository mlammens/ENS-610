# Meeting 9 - Air Pollution - Class and Reading Notes

## Learning Objectives

* Identify different types of air pollution and describe their global effects
* Be able to describe the processes associated with acid deposition and its environmental effects
* Identify ways of reducing air pollution and discuss socio-economic challenges associated with air pollution reduction

## In class activity

* Break up into groups of 2-3 students
* Compare and contrast what you learned regarding air pollution by reading Lovett et al. vs Vásquez et al.
    * How do the foci of these papers differ?
    * How are they similar?
    * What "kinds" of papers are these?
* Design a citizen science participatory research project to study the impacts of diesel exhaust along an urban to rural gradient in our region. 
    * Things to think about while designing your project:
        - Is your data collection prone to biases?
        - What are your measurements?
        - What kinds of data are you collecting?
        - What key environmental processes do you need information on?
        - Clearly identify what ideas / concepts you are getting from the two different papers.

## Reading notes

### Lovett et al.

* They make an important point that because so many of the pollutants that are considered "air pollutants" become deposited on the land, then leech into the water, they also lead to water pollution

* I think it's worth discussion the "Certainty of Information" section in a bit more detail as a group. Why the emphasis on experimental / gradient studies?

* Review Figure 1. Let's make sure we understand the "Green Line" / "Red Line" approach to dealing with novel (or current) toxins.
