## Reading Notes

### From Diaz and Rosenberg

* "The most serious threat from eutrophication is the unseen decrease in dissolved oxygen levels in bottom waters, created as planktonic algea die and add to the flow of organic matter to the seabed to fuel microbial respiration."
* Observed declines in DO have lagged about 10 years behind increased use of fertilizers.
* Some systems, e.g., the Black Sea, are experiencing multiple stressors - including overfishing, invasive species, etc.
* Perhaps go over / discuss stratification of aquatic systems
* In ecosystem responses, there is a discussion about changes to a species habitat due to hypoxia. This is interesting when you think about our discussion last week on niches.
* Note that hypoxia can effect biogeochemical cycling, such as the effects on nitrogen cycles noted in ecosystem response section
* The extent of ecosystem degredation may be linked to the duration of exposure and DO concentration.
* Might be worth discussing hysteresis - "the dependence of the state of a system on its history"
