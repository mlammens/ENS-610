# Meeting 6 - Water Pollution - Class Plan and Lecture Notes

## Brief paper discussion of Ripple and Beschta (5:45 - 6:00 PM)

* How many of you had heard this story before? 
* Fifteen years on, still recovering. This is almost surely still true to this day.
* Yellowstone - a three trophic level system
    * One could argue it's a bit more complicated than this
* There's a strong analogy between Yellowstone's elk and the northeast's deer problems. No wolf or other top predators.
* On page 206, the authors state "Two potential bottom-up factors ..." -- let's discuss bottom up versus top down ecosystem control. 
* Increases in plant growth are patchy, associated with perceived risk of predation.

## Discussion of Ecosystems - Biodiversity and Biological Resources (6:00 - 7:15 PM)

* Small groups regroup! (6:00 - 6:15 PM)
* Full class discussion (6:15 - 7:15 PM)

### Instructor-established LOs for this discussion

* Identify key principles of population ecology that are important in understanding your case study.
* Identify key principles of community ecology that are important in understanding your case study.
* Describe the ways that *biodiversity* is impacted in your case study, both directly and indirectly.

## Short break (7:15 - 7:20 PM)

## Case study discussions and LO work (7:20 - 8:30)

### Instructor-established Learning Objectives for Water Pollution

* Describe the eight major categories of water pollution (see Water Pollution slide deck) in general, and identify which categories each of the case studies relates to.
* Contrast the difference between point source and nonpoint source pollution, and identify which is a more appropriate classification for each of the case studies.
