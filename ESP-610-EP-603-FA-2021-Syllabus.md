Course description
------------------

This course is designed to help future environmental scientists and
policy makers achieve the level of scientific literacy required to
assess the quality of scientific evidence and to think critically about
environmental issues. Students will be guided through key topics in
environmental science, expanding their scientific literacy and helping
them to connect how scientific knowledge and research applies to, and
influences, environmental research, law, and policy.

Class materials
---------------

**Course readings:**

During the semester, we will read peer reviewed articles, as well as sections of several IPCC reports (AR5 and other special reports).
The readings will be shared via a shared [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library and through our class page on Pace's Learning Management System (LMS) [Classes](https://classes.pace.edu)

Learning Objectives
-------------------

Upon successful completion of this course, a student should be able to:

-   Demonstrate scientific literacy in written and verbal
    *communications*.
-   Apply a conceptual and systems level understanding of our
    environment and the flux of energy through it in addressing
    environmental issues.
-   Describe the key biogeochemical cycles that are integral to life on
    earth, including the hydrologic cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen
    cycle, and articulate human impacts on these cycles.
-   Discuss the interconnectedness of organisms in natural ecosystems
    and the importance of biodiversity and *explain its importance* to
    human and ecosystem well-being.
-   Identify major biodiversity and environmental conservation
    strategies in use locally and globally, and *describe the social
    issues* that must be integrated with conservation efforts.
-   Explain the impacts resource use and extraction have on natural
    systems and argue what is meant by sustainability and "ecosystem
    services" and why they are *important in law and policy*.
-   Describe how humans impact the environment through coupled
    human-natural systems, and be able to *propose studies and policies*
    to further investigate and mitigate these effects.
-   Identify the difficulties associated with solving environmental
    problems, and *articulate* why these are often termed “wicked
    problems”.

Program Learning Objectives
-------------------------

This course covers the following MS Environmental Science program-level
learning objectives:

-   Communicate complex scientific findings and exchange knowledge
    regarding multi-faceted environmental issues with a broad spectrum
    of audiences
-   Contextualize research on solving environmental challenges that
    includes economic, social, and political factors
-   Understand and critique the current state of knowledge on
    environmental issues and identify important knowledge gaps that need
    further investigation 

This course covers the following MA Environmental Policy program-level
learning objectives:

-   Communicate and exchange knowledge on the concepts behind
    environmental problems and policy solutions, based on scientific
    findings, with probable stakeholders such as policymakers,
    practitioners, and community members 
-   Employ interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary thinking in order to
    analyze effective environmental policy choices for industry,
    government, and non-governmental institutions 

Class structure
---------------

Each class meeting will be 3 hours. The class will include discussion and
group work, with inclusion of lecture material from Prof.
Aiello-Lammens to cover major concepts. Each week we will discuss the assigned
readings, and connect the topics in these readings to key concepts in
environmental science and policy. During a typical
class session, approximately 1/3 of the time will be dedicated to
discussion of the reading, 1/3 to lecture, and 1/3 to group work.

Assignments and assessments
---------------------------

Rubrics will be provided for class assessments.

-   Weekly reading comments - Perusall (10%)
-   Weekly reading response (25%)
-   Weekly in-class assignments (10%)
-   Discussion leader (5%)
-   Research paper proposal (5%)
-   Research paper annotated bibliography (10%)
-   Draft research paper (10%)
-   Peer-review of research paper (5%)
-   Final research paper (20%)

### Weekly reading comments - Perusall

Each week, we will read 1-2 papers that are common to the whole class.
These papers will be shared via a Zotero group library (we'll go over Zotero during Meeting 3) and via Perusall (linked from our Classes page).
Using Perusall, you will make highlights and marginal comments on the papers as a class.
Your score for these assignments will be based on the extensiveness and thoughtfulness of your questions and comments, the total number of comments, and whether you are engaging with other students.

### Weekly reading responses 

All students must come to class ready to engage with the material and
fully participate in the in-class discussions. To stimulate
thinking prior to the meeting time, each student is required to submit a
300 to 500 word written response to the reading.
I will post reading response **prompts** each week.

### Discussion leader

The discussion leader is responsible for leading the discussion and
synthesis session.
They will come prepared with a brief (less than 5 minute) overview presentation of the reading (slide deck is optional) and questions and/or discussion points to stimulate a synthetic conversation. These questions must be shared with Prof. Aiello-Lammens by Monday 9 AM the week they are leader.


### Peer-review of research paper

You will perform a peer-review of the research paper draft for a fellow student. 
We will discuss this assignment and process further in class.

### Term research paper

The research paper should be a thorough review of a topic in
environmental science ***OR*** of the scientific basis for a piece of
environmental law or policy. The paper should be 10 - 15 pages of
content (double spaced), excluding figures, title page, references
cited, etc.. At least 25 references to ***peer-reviewed*** or other
scholarly work should be used and cited appropriately in-text. The final
draft of the paper is due on the last day of the semester
– ***December 22***.

I will read and comment on **a draft of your paper**, and will expect my comments to be addressed in the final version.
A draft will be due by ***December 7***.

Course Policies
---------------

### Attendance

Attendance and punctuality are required. Excused absences will be
considered, but must be discussed with me. Unexcused
absences and/or consistent lateness will negatively impact your
final assessment and could result in failure.

### Technology in the Classroom

Use of computers and tablets may be necessary to complete some in-class
assignments. However, I expect you to respectful and professional, and
not to be “surfing the internet” during class. All computers, tablets,
phones, etc. should be closed and put away when not needed for course
work.


## University Policies and Resources

### Pace University COVID-19 Safety

With the Delta variant of COVID-19 now dominant, New York City and Westchester are both designated as areas of “high community transmission.” 
Under current guidance from the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, face coverings are recommended in such areas. 
Effective immediately, Pace University is requiring face coverings to be worn indoors on all our campuses. 
We are also encouraging face coverings outdoors, in situations when distance cannot be maintained. 
Any student entering class without a face covering will be asked to: a) don a face covering or b) go to Security to obtain a face covering if the student does not have one. 
Students who do neither of these things will be asked to leave class and they will be marked absent for the session. 
This policy will be re-evaluated as conditions change.

Vaccines are required for everyone in our community coming to campus, beginning on August 16, 2021. 
If you have not yet uploaded your vaccine record, please do so immediately via the confidential [Patient Portal](https://shibboleth.pace.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO?execution=e1s1).

### Learning Commons 

The [Learning Commons](https://www.pace.edu/learning-commons) uses an array of programs and a holistic approach to assist students with academic skills and content knowledge. We are dedicated to developing independent learners through purposeful interactions with trained, well-qualified peer and professional staff. Services offered:

* Content Support Services including, content tutoring, exam review sessions, & content preparation/support workshops
* Academic Skills Services including small group peer mentoring, academic skills workshops, and individual academic development
* Writing Support Services including, writing tutoring & writing preparation/support workshops


### Academic integrity

Students in this course are required to adhere to Pace University's [Academic Integrity Code](https://www.pace.edu/sites/default/files/2021-04/academic-integrity-code.pdf), which supports honesty and ethical conduct in the educational process. It educates students about what constitutes academic misconduct, helps to deter cheating and plagiarism, and provides a procedure for handling cases of academic misconduct. Students are expected to be familiar with the Code, which can be found in [Policies and Procedures](https://www.pace.edu/student-handbook/university-policies-disciplinary-and-grievance-procedures). Individual schools and programs may have additional standards of academic integrity. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the policies of the schools, programs, and courses in which they are enrolled.  

### Procedure for Students Who Wish to Obtain Reasonable Accommodations for a Course

The same rigorous standards for admission apply to students with and without a disability. In order to support the continued success of students with disabilities, the University prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability and is committed to ensuring equal access for students with disabilities to its facilities, programs, and activities. The University’s commitment to equal educational opportunities for students with disabilities includes providing reasonable accommodations for the needs of students with disabilities.

To request an accommodation for a qualifying disability, a student must self-identify and register with the Disability Services Office for his or her campus. The Office of Disability Services is housed in the Counseling Center on the New York City and Pleasantville campuses. No one, including faculty, is authorized to evaluate the need and arrange for an accommodation except the Coordinator of Disability Services. Moreover, no one, including faculty, is authorized to contact the Coordinator of Disability Services on behalf of a student.
