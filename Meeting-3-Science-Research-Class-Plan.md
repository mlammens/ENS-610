## Introduction to Zotero

*NOTE: These notes are covered in the Zotero video on Classes.*

1. Navigate to [zotero.org](zotero.org)
2. Create a new account (this is free)

### Plan for ENS-610-2020 Group

All students need to send me their Zotero user names

## Following a citation trail

  - Look at the references in the 'PCB Contamination of the Hudson River Ecosystem' report from Week 2.
  - Choose one of the **peer reviewed** referenced articles; look it up by title in Google Scholar
  - Click on 'Search within citing articles'

## Answering Hudson River PCB class follow-up questions

- Break up into five groups
- Each group, choose one of the questions, and search for papers that will help answer that question
- Your groups goal is to find at least five articles related to the question. Of those five, at least three should follow the IMRD format (feel free to earmark anything else that looks interesting)
- Prepare a synthesis of what you found, as a way of answering the question
- Your synthesis should include a **formatted** references cited section
