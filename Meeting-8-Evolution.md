## Response Prompt

From 2018 - perhaps edit a bit.

Has the intensive use of POPs been efective to control or erradicate plagues or unwanted organisms, and what adaptations made insects resilient to POPs?   Support your answer with Carson and Enayati et al 2005.

Even though industrialization brought with it the intensive use of POPs; how can we take a different path to avoid a no-turning-back point or is there a way to determine a rate of pesticide used to avoid increasing mutation frequencies?  Support your answer with Carson and Gressel, 2010.
