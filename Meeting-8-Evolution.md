## Response Prompt

From 2018 - perhaps edit a bit.

Has the intensive use of POPs been efective to control or erradicate plagues or unwanted organisms, and what adaptations made insects resilient to POPs?   Support your answer with Carson and Enayati et al 2005.

Even though industrialization brought with it the intensive use of POPs; how can we take a different path to avoid a no-turning-back point or is there a way to determine a rate of pesticide used to avoid increasing mutation frequencies?  Support your answer with Carson and Gressel, 2010.

## Reading Notes

### Carson CH 14 - 17

* CH 14 - rates of cancer have dramatically increased over the 50 year period from 1900 to 1950s, particularly among children

* CH 14, p 224 - legal process lead to slow / delayed process of reacting to a insecticide that clearly was associated with cancer

* CH 14, p 227 - Carson points to the notiable increase in leukemia in recent years, and suggests this might be a rapidly developing cancer

* CH 14, p 231-232 - discussion of the state-of-knowledge (as of 1960) of the mechanisms of cancer. Interesting topic of discussion is how far we have come in our knowledge on this to-date.

* p 234 - Leukemia may be prominent because bone marrow has relatively *higher* rates of cell division (because blood turnover).

* CH 15 - "Nature is not so easily molded ..."

* CH 15, p 246 - Her statement about how some "dismiss the balance of nature as a state of affairs that prevailed in an earlier, simpler world" is interesting. It reminds me of the shifting baseline syndrome, in that the idea that we could somehow return to previous situations is silly, and we should work to make the current situation better.

CH 15, p 247 - Essentially, she is discussing carrying capacity at the top of this page.

CH 15 - much of the chapter includes examples of ways food webs, communities, or ecosystems were indirectly perturbed by some impact of spraying or eradication. E.g., mice increasing after coyote hunting, orange scale becoming more problematic after vedalia killed indirectly, etc. 

CH 15 - the chapter ends with discussions of an alternative pest management strategy that is largely reminicient of what we call IPM today

CH 16 - examples of insecticide resistance

CH 17 - other options discussed, including *Bt*. 

CH 17, p 297 - last paragraph - "The control of nature ..." - certainly quote worthy.

### Enayati et al. 2005

Most notes in margin of paper copy.

This article is quite technical, and I think dives quite a bit into molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance. I like it because it is, compared to many other articles we read, *very* technical and provides an overview into the mechanisms of at least one form of insecticide resistance.

### Gressel 2011

Most notes in margin of paper copy.

In discussing this paper, in the opening paragraph, it is probably good to discuss soft vs hard selection.

Upon reading this paper again, my general impression is that the author does carry a pro-pesticide bias. (Though perhaps that is just my thinking with a pesticide skeptical bias.)
