## Following a citation trail

  - Look up the title of the Vitousek et al. 1997 paper in Google Scholar, note that you can select the 'Cited by xxxx', this brings you to the papers that have cited this one as part of thier works cited
  - Click on 'Search within citing articles'
  - Each group, choose a topic, and search for papers that are related to your chosen topic within those citing Vitousek
  - Your groups goal is to find at least five articles that follow the IMRD format (feel free to earmark anything else that looks interesting)
  - Prepare a synthesis of what you found, as a way of giving us an update on these topics since 1997
