# Annotated Bibliography Assignment Description

Your Annotated Bibliography ﻿﻿﻿﻿for your Final Research Paper should contain **no fewer than 15 sources** (recall that the final paper must include at least 25 sources to scholarly work).
For both the Annotated Bibliography and the Final Research Paper, you should use the American Psychological Association (APA) citation format.
For each reference, I expect a few brief statements regarding the information you plan to use from this source in your paper. 

Here is an example:

Gressel, J. (2011). Low pesticide rates may hasten the evolution of resistance by increasing mutation frequencies. Pest Management Science, 67(3), 253–257. https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.2071
* Discusses impacts of use of pesticides at low doses on the evolution of insect pesticide resistance
* Very low, sub-lethal doses may lead to an increase in adaptation to pesticides - i.e., increase in rate of resistance
* Argues that understanding mutation rates may be an important factor in understanding evolution of pesticide resistance
* Interesting example of resistance to *Bt* toxin - see bottom of page 255
